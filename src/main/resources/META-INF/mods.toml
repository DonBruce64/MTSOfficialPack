A small selection of content made by the core Immersive Vehicles (MTS) team.  This pack aims to show a little of all the things the mod can do, but not focus in any one area too heavily.  A good all-around starter pack.

Credits go to Don Bruce, Limit, Wolfvanox, Cactus, Fsendventd, and last, but certianly not least, Mr Mulle.
